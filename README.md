# Stream Watcher (Front)

This code has been imported from the global Stream Watcher repository. It's become quite old (3 years as of this commit), but it still works.

# Improvements

## Architecture

Rework the connection with the back-end. It was an opportunity to test WebSockets, it works well, but not the most readable. It should be replaced with a REST API.

## Design

It's kinda ugly. It should be improved.

Use Tailwind (it's a shame I didn't know it at the time).
